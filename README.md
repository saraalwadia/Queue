# Queue Data Structure in Java

This is a **Queue implementation from scratch using pure Java** (FIFO: First In, First Out).  
It is a console-based project designed to demonstrate how a queue works and how to implement it without using built-in Java libraries.

## Features
- Implements a queue using an integer array
- Supports main queue operations:
  - **Enqueue** – Add an element to the queue
  - **Dequeue** – Remove an element from the queue
  - **isEmpty** – Check if the queue is empty
  - **isFull** – Check if the queue is full
- Educational project to understand core data structure concepts

## Installation
